  "description": "This code is for a text-based fighting game written in TypeScript. Players choose an opponent from a list and engage in a turn-based battle. Each turn, the player can attack, drink a health potion, or run away. The outcome of an attack is random, with a 50% chance of success for both the player and the opponent. Players and opponents have a fuel stat that represents their health, and the game ends when either player's fuel reaches zero.",
